nZEDb-plusplus
================

This is a theme in development, with intended purpose of becoming the new default gold standard that all themes will eventually live up to.  
This theme only changes the front-end theme, which means if you have a custom admin section you can copy most of that over from your existing theme into the writhem nn++ theme. The one exception is the user-roles template... We've given you the ability to hide advertisements or show them based on role. 

Check the issues tab at top for a list of things to come, or request features to be developed into the theme.

Installation
------------

Copy the www folder over your current install, replacing files if prompted.

There are changes required to the db located in `dbchanges.sql`  
Changes to the core nZEDb+ files are located in `nZEDb.patch`  

There are references to the nZEDb lib path in each of the plugins in `www/lib/smarty/plugins/` as well. You may need to correct the full path that is defined in these until they are coded into the nZEDb core. This is a temporary step... bare with us.

Configuration
-------------

In the `www/templates/writhem/theme.php` file you can set multiple options. Including color, titles and file locations.

Stylesheets are located in `www/templates/writhem/styles/`. All colors that could be changed are located in `color.css`. 

If you change your icon for cart, you may want to change the css for the js driven images as well. Located on line 169 and 170. 

    div.icon_cart           { background-image:url('../images/icons/cartup.png'); }
    div.icon_cart_clicked   { background-image:url('../images/icons/cartdown.png'); }

Don't forget to change your menu names in the admin panel as well. 

To utilize the Realtime Status functionality, make sure you define your logs in your theme.php. If you are not currently outputing the php update scripts to a log file you should edit your update scripts. You can start a new log file by following this little slice of code sample

    set -e

    export nZEDb_PATH="/usr/local/www/nZEDb/misc/update_scripts"
    export nZEDb_SLEEP_TIME="600" # in seconds
    LASTOPTIMIZE=`date +%s`
    LOGFILE="/var/www/nZEDb/misc/update_scripts/logs/updating.log"

    while :

     do
    CURRTIME=`date +%s`
    cd ${nZEDb_PATH}
    /usr/bin/php5 ${nZEDb_PATH}/update_binaries.php > $LOGFILE
    /usr/bin/php5 ${nZEDb_PATH}/update_releases.php >> $LOGFILE

    DIFF=$(($CURRTIME-$LASTOPTIMIZE))
    if [ "$DIFF" -gt 43200 ] || [ "$DIFF" -lt 1 ]
    then
        LASTOPTIMIZE=`date +%s`
        /usr/bin/php5 ${nZEDb_PATH}/optimise_db.php >> $LOGFILE
        /usr/bin/php5 ${nZEDb_PATH}/update_tvschedule.php >> $LOGFILE
        /usr/bin/php5 ${nZEDb_PATH}/update_theaters.php >> $LOGFILE
    fi

    rm -f $LOGFILE
    echo "waiting ${nZEDb_SLEEP_TIME} seconds..."
    sleep ${nZEDb_SLEEP_TIME}

    done
